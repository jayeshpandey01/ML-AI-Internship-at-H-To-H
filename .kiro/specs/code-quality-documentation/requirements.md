5. WHEN writing README THEN it SHALL include Google Sheets setup instructions with screenshots or detailed steps
6. WHEN writing README THEN it SHALL provide a complete usage guide with examples
7. WHEN writing README THEN it SHALL include links to strategy explanation videos or documentation
8. WHEN writing README THEN it SHALL include links to output demonstration videos or examples
9. WHEN creating documentation THEN it SHALL include architecture diagrams showing system components
10. WHEN creating documentation THEN it SHALL include configuration examples and templates

### Requirement 4: Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to follow industry standards so that it is maintainable, readable, and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improving code quality THEN all code SHALL follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. WHEN checking code quality THEN it SHALL pass flake8 or pylint checks with minimal warnings
3. WHEN handling errors THEN all functions SHALL have proper exception handling for expected failure cases
4. WHEN handling API failures THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle network errors and rate limits
5. WHEN handling missing data THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback behavior
6. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and data integrity
7. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL use consistent naming conventions throughout
8. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL have appropriate logging levels for debugging and monitoring
9. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL include input validation for all public functions

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be thoroughly tested so that I can be confident in its reliability and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the system THEN it SHALL be validated with sample data to verify functionality
2. WHEN testing modules THEN each module SHALL be testable independently
3. WHEN testing data fetching THEN it SHALL handle various market conditions and data formats
4. WHEN testing trading strategy THEN it SHALL be validated against known market scenarios
5. WHEN testing ML models THEN it SHALL be validated with historical data and performance metrics
6. WHEN testing integrations THEN it SHALL verify Google Sheets and Telegram connectivity
7. WHEN testing error handling THEN it SHALL simulate failure conditions and verify recovery
8. WHEN creating tests THEN they SHALL include both unit tests and integration tests
9. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL provide clear pass/fail results and coverage information

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible configuration options so that I can customize the system for different use cases and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing configuration THEN all settings SHALL be centralized in configuration files
2. WHEN using configuration THEN it SHALL support environment-specific settings (dev, prod, test)
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL validate all required settings on startup
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN it SHALL use environment variables for API keys and tokens
5. WHEN providing configuration THEN it SHALL include example configuration files with documentation
6. WHEN updating configuration THEN it SHALL not require code changes for common customizations
7. WHEN validating configuration THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid settings

### Requirement 7: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging and monitoring so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
